# NanoString Spatial Omics Hackathon Submission

We developed a web application based on dash.jl which provides an interactive interface to ease the task of analysing a multidimensional dataset as the one provided for this hackaton.

The application allows to filter the data and generate different views which helps to detect groups of interests.
This groups can be later analysed and compared using R standard packages.
